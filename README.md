## Javascript Slider - Laurens Trotsenburg

###Reason why i didnt finish:
I made a javascript slider with es5 and a little with es6 in one file
so thats why i didnt finish the assignment. But I did learn how to use es6 a little.

###What i made in this slider:

<ul>
    <li>Keydown function that makes you skip out a slide with left and right.</li>
    <li>Automatic slider that can be stopped and started with two buttons</li>
    <li>Two buttons on the side of the start and stop buttons too also skip to a next slide</li>
</ul>
